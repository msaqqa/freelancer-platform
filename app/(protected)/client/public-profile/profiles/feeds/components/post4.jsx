        This doesn’t mean that all bloggers are insincere fakers. On the
        contrary, many bloggers’ natural curiosity is what makes them great at
        what they do. If you blog for a living, you have to be comfortable
        jumping from one topic to the next, even if you don’t know anything
        about it.
